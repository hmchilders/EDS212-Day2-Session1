## Derivatives

```{r}
#define the expression
fx = expression(3.1 * (x ^ 4) - 28 * x)

#find the derivative, and store the derivative as df_dx
#the D() function only works for a previous defined expression using expression()
df_dx = D(fx, "x")

#Prints the derivative expression
df_dx

#set a value for x
x <- 10

#Evaluate the slope of fx at x=10
# eval() evaluates and expression
 eval(df_dx)

```

Find the slope of the function g(x) = 2z^3^ - 10.5z^2^ + 4.1 at z=3.6

```{r}
gz = expression(2*z^3-10.5*z^2+4.1) #defines expression
dg_dz = D(gz, "z") #define and stores derivative
dg_dz #print/call derivative expression 

z <- 3.6 #define the variable at the evaulated number
eval(dg_dz) #evaluate derivates

z <- seq(1,3,length=20) #define the variable as a sequence of values
eval(dg_dz) #evaluate derivate for the sequence

```
